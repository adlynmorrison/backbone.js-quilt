The protagonists are Billy and Jimmy Lee, the titular duo and the successors of a fictional martial arts style known as Sou-Setsu-Ken. One day, Billy's girlfriend, a former student named Marian, is kidnapped off the street and the Lee brothers receive a letter from her captors, the Black Warriors, demanding to known the secrets of the Double Dragons in exchange for her release. The Black Warriors are the largest criminal organization in the city."

Pro-Am, this game is an action racing game in the diagonal perspective, though instead of cars the game features boats. The overall objective of Cobra Triangle is to complete all the missions in a given amount of time while avoiding obstacles such as sharks, jumps, and enemy boats. Missions include collecting items or racing opposing boats. The game uses a powerup bar similar to the Gradius series.'

Bang soon encounters Tom Guycot, the mastermind behind the professor\'s abduction. He also learns from his dying friend Joe that the Doomsday Bomb is controlled by six medallions which have been distributed among Guycot\'s minions, the governors of Demonhead. Traveling through the game\'s various routes, Bang faces down the governors and acquires their medallions.'

		'description' => 'Despite being more realistic than other games of the era, like Ten Yard Fight, Tecmo Bowl still had some faults. For instance, any pass thrown to a covered receiver resulted in an interception, and it was unrealistically easy to block field goals and extra points. A player using the New York Giants, for example, could easily block every kick using Lawrence Taylor simply by selecting him and running through the blockers. Tecmo Bowl contains twelve teams, each equipped with four plays. Most teams have two running plays and two passing plays. The exceptions being San Francisco and Miami who have three passing plays and one running play. Tecmo, Inc. was not able to get the NFL\'s consent to use real team names. As a result, the teams in the game are identified solely by their home city or state. However, each roster conveniently mimics that of the NFL team based out of the same city or state.'

The time to beat is located on the stadium walls (for first place) and in the lower left corner (for third place). In any race, the best time is 8 seconds ahead of third place. When the player places first, then they get a message: "It\'s a new record!" The player controls the position of the red motorcycle with the Y-axis of the directional pad, and controls acceleration with the A and B buttons Using B causes improved acceleration, but causes the motorcycle\'s temperature to increase as shown on a bar at the bottom of the screen. If the temperature exceeds safe limits (the bar becomes full), the player will be immobilized for several seconds while the bike cools down. If the bike goes over an arrow, it is automatically cooled down.'

The player begins with a very limited amount of power-ups, but must always use their ingenuity to achieve the next "locked" or unreachable area. Because the game world is presented in one multi-screened "level," there are often areas that can be reached before they were meant to be by creative players. In later games in the Metroid series, this would lead to out-of-sequence speed runs. Metroid has five different endings that vary depending on how much time the player takes to finish the game.'

The game follows a more or less linear path from start to finish, and fights take place in the style of Double Dragon (another Technos hit), with the player moving Alex (Kunio) or Ryan (Riki) around the screen using the directional pad, and pressing buttons to punch, kick, or jump. However, the characters\' effectiveness in battle is determined by several statistics and their knowledge of fighting techniques, such as Acro Circus, Stone Hands, and Dragon Feet, which are purchased like items in shops throughout the city using funds recovered from defeated gang members. This loot may also be spent on various food items and spa treatments which serve to revitalize the player\'s stats while displaying a funny animation.'

The ultimate object is to race through the Mushroom Kingdom, evade or eliminate King Koopa\'s forces, and save Princess Peach (or "Princess Toadstool" as she was commonly known in North America until 1996). Mario\'s primary attack is simply jumping on top of his enemies, which kills the mushroom traitors, known as Goombas, and sends the turtle soldiers known as Koopa Troopas into their shells. Mario can then kick these shells into other enemies, which will conveniently dispatch them; but conversely, kicked shells can bounce back off walls or other vertical obstructions and hit him. Jumping on enough enemies in succession or kicking a shell into enough enemies in succession (combos) results in double points earned with each enemy killed, eventually earning Mario a 1-up, an extra life and another chance to pass the level. Some enemies, though, such as Spinies, can be killed only by fireballs or shell impact; stomping them will hurt Mario.'

Coordination of the character\'s movement is essential, as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player\'s character and also discard the current weapon from the player\'s inventory. It is not unusual for the screen to be occupied with several enemies and dozens of bullets moving in different directions all at once in the game\'s eight stages.'

Whereas Commando is a run and gun game, this game is a scrolling shooter in which the screen scrolls upward automatically and players only have three ways to shoot which is done with three buttons for left, right, and center shooting. However, a player can also change the way Billy shoots through button combinations. You can still die by getting shot or struck by enemies like in Commando but you can better protect yourself by getting special items like: a horse, for protection up to three hits; boots, for speed of movement; bullets, for faster shots; and rifles, for shot length. You find these items by shooting barrels and you can stock up rifles, boots, and bullets up to five.'

At first, the player starts the game unarmed, but eventually gains access to a variety of firearms (starting with the Beretta M92F) and explosives and working his way up to machine guns and guided rocket launchers. Ammo and supplies for each weapon are limited, but are easily replenished. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles (such as hollow walls or electrified floors). Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies and take any food, ammo, or any other important items (such as keys) they leave behind.'

		'description' => 'Each team is comprised of six players; three players are constrained to one half of the main dodgeball court, while the other three stand at the sidelines surrounding the opposing team. Before play begins, the player may chose the configuration of the six players on the court. During play, the player (or players) may pass the dodgeball with A or perform an attacking throw with B. Players can jump by pressing both A and B, move using the directional pad (although sideline players are restricted to the area adjacent to their sideline) and run (in-bounds players only) by tapping left or right continuously. A ball can be caught by pressing B slightly before impact; pressing A without the ball will cause the player to duck. Being struck with an attack causes a player to lose health points; being struck with a pass stuns the player. A team is victorious when all three opposing in-bounds players have lost their health; sideline players are immune to such a loss, but can still be stunned when struck. In addition, throwing the ball after running for a certain distance will unleash a Power Shot that is significantly more powerful, hard to track, and hard to catch. Due to the lack of mobility of the sideline players, they generally cannot throw these attacks. You can also throw an aerial Power Shot by jumping during a run and throwing the ball at the peak of your jump; however, you do not need to run at any particular distance to throw one.'

There are a few 3D and traditional 2D "beat-em-up" levels where the player progresses by defeating enemies, though even these levels tend to have many lethal obstacles. The most difficult levels are the obstacle course and race levels, where the character must dodge a series of obstacles while driving or flying at high speed, or outrun an enemy that can instantly kill the player. These levels typically required the player to memorize the sequence of obstacles in the way, and to have extremely rapid reflexes. Other levels include a climbing/jumping "snake maze", an underwater level with lethal spikes and dangerous monsters, and two difficult "tower climb" levels, including the final climb of the Dark Queen\'s tower.'

Also, only the portion of the track around the player\'s vehicle is displayed, as opposed to the whole entire track. The game is presented from an isometric viewpoint, giving an illusion of three dimensions. The controls are simple, with one button being used to accelerate, and the other used for either firing weapons or honking the horn. The sound is very minimal in the game, with title and game over music numbers, track and racing sound effects, and a short melody played right before each race.'

Mega Man is made up of six stages, with a Robot Master at the end guarding a weapon. The stage select screen allows the player to choose from these six stages, and when they are all completed, the seventh and last stage appears in middle of the menu, replacing the text "Stage Select, Press Start". This last stage is in fact more like four regular stages linked together, some a bit shorter than average, but with very hard bosses.'
